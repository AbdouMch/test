hello world!
this my second modification after updating my local repository
waw Ã§a roule!!!
And after modification in the cloud it must rain to the computer by the command git pull

Create a repo from command line

echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/AbdouMch/test.git
git push -u origin master
